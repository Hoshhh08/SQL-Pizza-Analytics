Pizza Sales Data Analysis - MySQL Project

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using MySQL. It contains SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced levels, helping to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. The queries cover fundamental operations, aggregations, joins, window functions, and advanced data manipulations.

Dataset

The dataset includes transaction details related to pizza sales, such as order dates, pizza types, quantities, prices, and customer details. The data has been structured into relational tables for efficient querying.
